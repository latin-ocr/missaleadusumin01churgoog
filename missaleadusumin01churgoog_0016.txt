These variatione would be abundantly sufficient to test any MS.
Missal of unknown Use, which gave the Sequences and the Ferial
Epistles and Gospels. Where these are not given, the only test
left 10 the Verse after the Alleluya 011 the Second Sunday, 111 which
Verse the York and Lincoln agree.

This i's not an unimportant difference, though it would not at
all follow that a Missal with this Verse must be either 01 the York
01 Lincoln Use. 11 10 found in the second portion 01 the
York Misaal, belonging to the Vicar 01 Leeds, which is described
Vol. i. pp. vii-x, and which portionis very possibly 01 Lincoln
use3 it certainly is not that 01 York, Sarum, 01 Hereford.

Another 1001 may possibly be found in a case where the
Calendar 0111010, by the date 01 the Feast 01 Relics, which 01 Lin-
coln, 00 will be seen below, p. 272, was kept 01 Lincoln on J uly 14,
though it 10 possible that the 001110 day may be intended as in the
Sarum and Hereford Missals, where tha Feast is entered for the
Sunday following the 8th 01 J uly. 11 seems hardly possible, there· ,
1010, 10 determine 0 MS. Missal 10 the Lincoln 1100, until 0110 with
the Ferial Epistles and Gospels and the Sequenoes agreeing with
the Fragment hasbeen discovered.

The matter might be left here, but there are two MSS. which
appear, or at least have appeared, 10 prove that the Lincoln 1100
was only a variation 01 the Sarum, and only called a 1100 111 the
same sense as the Ripon Usa is spoken of.

Itis given in the Printed Oatalogue 01 the Cambridge MSS, from
the arms emblazoned in the illuminated borders, as that 01 John
Russell, Bishop 01 Lincoln, 1480-1494, and is cited as such in the
notes to the “ Translation of the Sarum Missal.'' There is no doubt
that the 1100 01 the Diocese, for the Bishop of which this volume was ’

written, was Sarum. But it appears 011 further examination that
the arms are not those 01 Bishop Russell3* and a MS. “Transla-
