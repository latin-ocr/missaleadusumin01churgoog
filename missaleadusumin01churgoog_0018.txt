Prcsccc. xiii ·

arc assumed to do so in this case, it will be found, I think, on com·
paring the Oanon of the Mass, and the several Masses given in the
Appendix with the Sarum Missal, that there are scarcely sufficient
differcnces to indicate even a variation from the Sarum Use. sse
same must bc said of the Offices for Baptism aud Matrimony.
But these two are merc summaries. They will be given at length ,
in the Appendix to the York Manual, shortly to be printed by the
Surtees Society.

The Office for the Burial of the Dead is peculiar and long.
It will be given in the same volume.

There remain, as given in the Appendix, the Forms-

1. For Blessing Oandles at the Purification.

2. For Ponitents on Ash Wednesday.

3. For Blessing Palms on Palm Sunday.

4. For Blessing Fire in Holy chln

5. For Reconciling Penitents on Holy Thursday.

These vary very considerable from the Printed Sarum Missal but
they are identiccl with the Forms found in the Pontificals of the
lach Oentmy, which, for reasons Ihave stated in the Preface to

the Surtees Edition of the “ Pontifical of Archbishop Bainbridge,''

Ι believe to have given the original arrangement of Bishop Osmund.
As to the Masses given in the Pontifical, the only variations
from the Sarum are—

, l. In the Postcommunion of the Mass“Pro Sacerdote ct Episcopo.'’ ·
2. In the Secret of that “Pro Sacerdotc.'’
3. In the Postcommunion of that “Pro vivis et Defunctis.''

The List of Saints' Days for which Episcopal Benedictions are
given is very peculiar, including those of the Founders of the great
Orders—St. Francis (Day and Translation)‚ st. Dominio, St. Olair,
,and St. Bernard Of these the Feast of St. Francis only is found

in the Oalcndars of the Three Missals. q

Ι feel strongly inclined on the whole tothe conclusion that this ’
Pontifical was compiled, or rather copied from one compiled, without
any reference to the Use of Bangor.
