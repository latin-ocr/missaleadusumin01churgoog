PREFAOE.

Ir does not seem necessary to add anything to what has been

already said in the Preface to the first Volume in regard to the
Missal of the York Uss. A few remarks only seem requisita as to
some of the Documenta printed in the Appendix, principally with
ψ regard to the Uses of Linooln and Bangor.

ΟΝ ΤΗΕ USE OF LINGOLN.

Arrnwnrx N o. VI. is the fragment of a Missal of the Linsoln
Use, from a MS. of the loth Century in the Bodleian Library.

The fragment consiste of the Offioos from the First Sunday in
Arlrent to the Wednesday following tha Third Suaday.

The question is, whether the Linooln Use, as spoken of here
and in the Prefaee to the English Prayer Book, was a distinet Use
in the sense in which the Sarum, York, and Hereford were, or only

a variation from one or other of these Uses.

The following table of differenees between this Fragment and
the corresponding portion of the three great Uses appears to prove
that the Lincoln Use was no mere variation, but a distinet Use in

the full sense of the term :-
