Resides which are inserted in a different hand, “ Festum de Nomine
Jesn,'' the Mass for St. David as given above, lor the Dedication
of a Ghurch, and for the Purification with the “Benedictio
luminis.''

There is therefore amply sufficient to determine the Use, which
clearly is Sarum pure aud simple, with only the addition of special
office for S. David,x just as the “ Ripon Use '' seems to have con-
sisted simply of the York, with an office for St. Wilfrid, or as
probably almost every Ohurch had a special form for the Feast of
the Saint to whom it was dedicated.

Al PP· 61 and 62 aaraa the MS. declares its “Use ''-

Natamdam aot qaod ia iata praefatione aaaqaaaa da‘catar, Per beatos

Ita tamea quad arcaea praefationes tatius cani aab laac tona dicantar,

cacan aawoa.

The Mass for the Dedication of the Ohurch, which includes the
Sequanae and the Blessing of Tapers in the Purification, which are
added in the same hand as the Mass for S. David, are identical
with the sarum Form.

Tho same is the case with the Canon, which-has a considerable
amount of rubrio.
