xviii Proface.

The only difference 01 any importance in the Earlier Offioes in
the Volumo is in the Service 101 Matrimony, ‘f Vir autem stet a Ἴ
sinistris mulieris et mulier a dextris viri‚'' as in the Hereford

Form, and the ⁴“ Manda Deus '' and Preces precede the giving of'
the ring. ’
The forms 01 betrothal are—

Ich N. take the N. to my weddid wyf, 101 1011010 101 10111010, 101
ricchere 101 porer‚ for 1101010101 vers, in siknesse and in helthe, 10110
deth us departe, and 01111Ι to the holde‚ and tharto ich plyztte my* treuthe.

Ich N. tak ye N. to my‘ wedded husbond‚ 101 1011010 101 10111010, 101·
richer 101 10101, 101 beter fervens, in siknes and in heltho, to be boner
and buxsum in bedde and at bord and only 10 ye holde‚ 10110 deth us

Wyoh this gold ry‘ng y' ye wedde: gold and siluer ich yc geue, and

honours.

An exact collaticn 01 these Offices will be given in the Appen·

1111111111 IV. contains 0 collection 01 what are there called
Proses, the Sequences 01 0 10101 date, 110111 0 Troper in the
Bodleian Library, written some time during the reign 01 Ε11101111011,
and later than the Oanonization 01 S. Ethelwol .

This is certainly 1110 earliest known collection 01 Sequences:
fifty-five 01 them do not appear in any printed collection to which
Ihave had access. .

This MS. is the only English Troper known to exist. There
was once an English Troper in the Ohurch 01 S. Bavon 01 Ghent.
This is described by Pamelius in his “Liturgicon,'’ and a few
Tropes are given. The MS. cannot now be found. Itdoesnotappear
to have contained any Sequences. The Bodleian MS. is described by
Mr. Maskell, “Ritualia Ecclesia Anglicanac,’' 101. 1. pp. xxxin-xli,
and very fully by Dr. Book, “Ohurch of our F athers,’' vol iii.
part ii. 20-28.

I have printed the Proses from this volume, as the earliest
collection 01 those used in 1110 01111011 01 England, and also as there
appears good reason 101 believing with Dr. Rock that a large
portion 01 least 01 these Proses were written by Alcuin.
