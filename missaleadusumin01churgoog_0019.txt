Ιιι the Oathedral Library at Hereford is a Manual‚ which has
been most kindly lent to me by the Dean and Chapter, which once
belonged to a Ohurch in Wales.

The MS. is of the middle of the 15th (lentury. The name of'
the Ohurch to which it belonged is repeatedly given on the fly-
leaves as “Llan Vair Keria Radrarum'' or “Rodanum'' or
“y Kadarum.'' On the ily-leaves at the beginning and end are
extracta of the prooeedings of Ocurts held at Strad and Glyn.
There is also written on the fly-leaf at the end :—

In Dei nomine, Amen, Ego Thomas ap J evan Gr. condo testa-
m(entum) in hunc modurn: imprimis commend(o) animam meam Deo
omnipotenti (et corpus) meum ad sepeliendum in Ecclesia beatae Maria
et sancti Kinec (l). . . . et ult(erius).

There is some difficulty in identifying Llan Vair Keric
Kadarum.

“ Kerio '' appears clearly to be “ (lerrig ''—the stenes, probably
boundary or memorial. Two suggestions have been madeas to
the place intended-

1 That the name is a corruption of Llan- fair anreinion or
Llanfair· ··yn -anreinion ιιι hlont tgomeryshire, near Welshpool
which, ιιι a map of North Wales,1n Gibsorf‘s ‘,''Gamden pub-
lished 1695, 1s spelt Llanraier Inkrenion.

2. That Idan-fair·yn·(ledewaen‚ erasit is spelt in the map
abore referred to, Llanfairyn·Kidriorn,is intended. 'Ihis name
lius beon snperseded by the English ‘⁴ N ewtown.''

“sarad” for “ Ystrad‚'’ ta, stratum, street, and “ Glyn‚'' are too
common as Welsh names to gire any precise indication.

The name S. Kinec, of which only the last letter is doubtful,
and which may hare been written “Kinecii” or “Kineciae‚” aa>
two letters are missing, appears to represent St Iieyna, Geneu, or
Kupn3 but Ioannot find any church dedicated to St. hini-y and
St Koyn.

T tho book was of Welsh Use is also shown by the hiess-
l id, which Ι snbjoin :-
